# Cars-24 Price Prediction

Welcome to the Cars-24 Price Prediction project! This repository contains resources and code for building a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars. The goal is to assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions by providing accurate price estimations based on various car features.

## Project Overview

The automotive market is dynamic, with car prices influenced by multiple factors such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and more. Predicting the right price for a used car can be challenging. This project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and generate reliable price predictions.

## Features
